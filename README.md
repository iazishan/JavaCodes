## 📦 Project Structure

Each data structure is placed in its own file or directory and includes example usage or test cases where applicable.

### Included Implementations

- ✅ Arrays
- ✅ Linked Lists (Singly & Doubly)
- ✅ Stacks (Array & Linked List based)
- ✅ Queues (Simple & Circular)
- ✅ Deques
- ✅ Trees (Binary Tree, BST, AVL)
- ✅ Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- ✅ Hash Tables (Chaining, Linear Probing)
- ✅ Graphs (Adjacency List & Matrix)
- ✅ Tries (Prefix Trees)
- ✅ Sets & Maps (HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap)
